üß† How It Works
Sysmon logs process creation (event ID 1).

Wazuh custom rule checks the win.eventdata.company field.

If the company is not in the whitelist, an alert is triggered.

Active response runs PsSuspend via PowerShell to suspend or kill the process.

A user-facing balloon notification is displayed.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Sysmon on Windows Agent
Download Sysmon from Microsoft and deploy it using a preconfigured ruleset.
üì• Sysinternals PsTools

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Wazuh Manager Rules
Enable Sysmon rules:

cd /var/ossec/ruleset/rules/
nano 0595-win-sysmon_rules.xml
# Change rule level from 0 to 5 to see process creation logs.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Whitelist File
Create vendor list:


sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/lists/software-vendors
Example content:


Microsoft Corporation:
GitHub, Inc.:
Brave Software, Inc.:
Sysinternals:
Set permissions:


chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/etc/lists/software-vendors
chmod 640 /var/ossec/etc/lists/software-vendors
4Ô∏è‚É£ Add to Wazuh Configuration
In ossec.conf under <ruleset> section:

<list>etc/lists/software-vendors</list>
5Ô∏è‚É£ Import Custom Detection Rule
Append rules/local_rules.xml into:

/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml
6Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Active Response
In ossec.conf under <active-response>:


<command>
    <name>pssuspend</name>
    <executable>pssuspend.cmd</executable>
    <timeout_allowed>no</timeout_allowed>
</command>

<active-response>
    <disabled>no</disabled>
    <level>12</level>
    <command>pssuspend</command>
    <location>local</location>
    <rules_group>software_policy</rules_group>
</active-response>

7Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Scripts on Windows Agent
Place the following in C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\active-response\bin\:

pssuspend.cmd

pssuspend.ps1

Ensure PowerShell 7+ is installed to handle JSON parsing correctly.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Verify PsTools Path in Script
Update the PowerShell script (pssuspend.ps1) to reflect the correct path of:

PsExec64.exe

PsSuspend64.exe

PsKill64.exe

‚úÖ Example Alert
When a process from an unknown vendor (e.g., hacker.exe) runs, Wazuh logs:

Sysmon - Event 1: Process hacker.exe started but not allowed by the software policy.

The process is suspended and a user notification appears:

Application Suspended
An application was suspended due to the software policies in place.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
Make sure your software-vendors list is accurate to avoid suspending legitimate software. Test on a non-production environment first.
